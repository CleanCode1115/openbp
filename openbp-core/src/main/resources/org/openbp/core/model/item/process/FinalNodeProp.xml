	<description>An final node constitutes an exit, i.e. an ending point of a process.
The process execution will stop after processing the node. The entry parameters of the node will be the return parameters of the process.
An final node has exactly one entry socket, but no exit socket.

		<description>Scope of the final node
This property defines the visiblity of this final node when using this process as sub process.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public (default)
The exit will always be visible in sub process nodes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private
The exit will be visible only if the process is called from within itself (local sub process call).&lt;/li&gt;</description>

		<description>Jump target to continue with
If a jump target is specified, the process will resume at the given target.
A target can be specified as exit name, which will cause the OpenBP engine to look for an appropriate exit socket/initial node/proccess using the target search strategy (for details see the User Manual).
The special jump target &lt;mainpage&gt; will continue with the default entry of the default process of the executing model.
If no jump target has been specified, the node will simply return to the calling process.</description>
