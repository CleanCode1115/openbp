	<description>A data link connects an exit socket of a node to an entry socket of (presumably another) node.
This link resembles the flow of data in a process.</description>

		<description>Member of the source parameter's data type that is to be accessed
If the member path is empty, the entire source parameter is subject of the operation.
Example: For an Order object, the member specification might be "Buyer.Name" to refer to the buyer's name.</description>

		<description>Member of the target parameter's data type that is to be accessed
If the member path is empty, the entire target parameter will be set.
Example: In order to set the buyer's name in an Order object, the member specification might be "Buyer.Name".
If the Order or the order's Buyer object do not exist, they will be instantiated on the fly.</description>

		<description>If set, a copy of the parameter value will be copied.  Otherwise, the parameter will be passed by reference.
A call by reference is faster that a copy. However, if the parameter is a complex object and one of its member values is changed, this will also affect both the source and the target parameter since they refer to the same object.
In order to be copied, an object needs to implement the java.lang.Clonable interface.</description>
