	<description>An initial node constitutes an entry (a starting point) of a process.
An initial node has a number of entry parameters (these would be the parameters of the called process, i. e. the request parameters) that map to the exit parameters of the node.
An initial node has exactly one exit socket, but no entry socket.

&lt;li&gt;Public (default)
The initial node can be invoked using the process facade of the OpenBP engine.&lt;/li&gt;

The process can be called as a sub process by another process or itself, but not from a visual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Private
This initial node designates a local sub process, i. e. this entry can be called from within the process itself only.&lt;/li&gt;</description>
