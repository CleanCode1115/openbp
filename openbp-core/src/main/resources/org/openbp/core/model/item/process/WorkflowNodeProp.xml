		<description>Assign this workflow to the user who accepts it.
If selected, a workflow will be assigned to the user who accepted the workflow, regardless if it has been specified for this user or a group of users (a role).

This is useful if a user picks a workflow from a public worklist (i. e. from a list displaying workflows that have been assigned to some role). Now the workflow gets assigned to the particular user instead of the role. In case the user cancels the processing, he will find this particular workflow again in his private worklist and will be able to choose it again for processing.</description>
