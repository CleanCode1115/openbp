<!--
Note that this causes a change of the class loaders of the system.
Objects that have been created by a running process and stored in the token context of the session, may not be compatible with classes loaded by the new class loader.
This applies for example to compiled beans of the running models that have been stored as process variables.
This incompatibility may result in class cast exceptions being thrown when accessing the old objects for example in an activity implementation.
In this case, you should re-run the process from the debugger, which will remove the contexts of processes that have been started by the debugger before, thus removing any old objects.
