    <description>A workflow task is a portion of work to perform by a particular user or role as part of a workflow process.\n\nA workflow task is created by a workflow node.\n\nThe workflow task refers to a process that will be executed (and usually defines the user interface page flow the user has to run through) when the user selects the workflow task for processing.\n\nA workflow task is assigned either to a particular user (i. e. only this user can process the workflow task) or to a role (indicating that any user fullfilling this role can process the workflow task).\n\nOptionally, the workflow task has a defined due time. If the due time expires (or if the workflow task is assigned to another user or cancelled), a status change will be triggered in the process that created the workflow task.</description>
